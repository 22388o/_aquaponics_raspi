== Shell scripts
There is a huge connection of shell scrpits I created which are responsible for many diverse task, such us:

- setup and install of often used programs. (e.g. xrdp, samba, cifs, etc.)
- modules guiding you through longer install-processes. (e.g. basic RasPi install, Aquaponics, LndNode, etc.)
- prerequisites for Python installs of each cutstom made computers. (e.g. RoomManager, SecureBTC, etc.)

To set up your Aquaponic System you first need to go through the manual steps, then run
the following Shell scripts using bash. Before running the scriptscheck if hard-coded
variables match your installation. First and foremost check:

- username
- install directories
- remote paths

=== Automated install-scripts:
* `mngr_` [[shell:xrdp]]
* `mngr_` [[shell:samba]]
